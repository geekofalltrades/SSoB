# Stackable Stones of Barenziah with Optional Quest Markers

## Overview

A Skyrim mod which bugfixes the "No Stone Unturned" quest, allowing Stones of
Barenziah to stack properly in your inventory. Because quest markers on the
Stones are fairly popular, and this mod won't be compatible with other mods
which add them, I've also added them as an option.
