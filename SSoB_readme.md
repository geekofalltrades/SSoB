# Stackable Stones of Barenziah with Optional Quest Markers

Version: 2.0.0
Author: geekofalltrades
Released: 2022-01-15 at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus

Allows Stones of Barenziah to stack normally in your inventory. Because quest
markers for Stones of Barenziah are fairly popular, and this mod won't be
compatible with other mods that add them, I have included them as an option. To
toggle quest markers, either use the Mod Configuration Menu (SSoB, for "Stack-
able Stones of Barenziah," or use the console ('`' - Backtick or Tilde key, by
default):

```
(to enable):
set SSoBGemMarkers to 1

(to disable):
set SSoBGemMarkers to 0
```

This mod's plugin is an ESP+FE/ESL-flagged ESP.

## Requirements

* SKSE
* SkyUI (for the Mod Configuration Menu)

## Compatibility

This mod overhauls the No Stone Unturned quest fairly radically, and so won't be
compatible with other mods that alter that quest. These include the popular
Quest Marker and Droppable Gem mods. SSoB should be compatible with any other
mod.

This mod forwards changes to No Stone Unturned from the Unofficial Skyrim
Special Edition Patch.

## Installation

Either install with a mod manager, or place SSoB.esp and SSoB.bsa in your
Skyrim Special Edition/Data directory.

## Uninstallation

If installed with a mod manager, deactivate or delete with that mod manager.
Otherwise, remove SSoB.esp and SSoB.bsa from your Skyrim Special Edition/Data
directory.

## Permissions
Do not reupload this mod at sites other than Nexus Mods. If you alter this mod
(by translating, adding functionality, etc) you may distribute it freely, so
long as I am credited as its original author; in this case, I would prefer that
it were made available at Nexus Mods.
